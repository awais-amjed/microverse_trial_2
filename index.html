        <h1>
          How Sisense Works
        </h1>
        <p>
          Sisense's end-to-end, single stack solution simplifies complex data in three short steps: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Model:</strong> Blend massive amounts of data from a variety of sources into Sisense. You can access data directly from the data source using Sisense Live, or import data into the Sisense ElastiCube.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analyze:</strong> Interact with your data in a visual way to get a deeper understanding of it, and visualize a clear picture of the holistic data landscape.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Impact:</strong> Create visually appealing dashboards that make it easy to get insights and take action. You can also take your stand-alone dashboards to the next level by turning them into fully integrated analytics apps. For example, use the popular Sisense Blox plugin to create advanced layouts, custom navigation, and even integrate third-party software (such as Salesforce) directly into your dashboards.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Sisense Deployments
        </h1>
        <p>
          You can use the Sisense Cloud Managed service or deploy Sisense in your cloud environment of choice, or on-premise.</p>
        <h3>
          Sisense Cloud Managed Service</h3>
        <p>
          This is the easiest and most recommended deployment option. Sisense provides an environment for you, based on your requirements. With the collaboration of your IT team, your data sources are connected to Sisense. This means you do not need to run any servers or special hardware or manage your own cloud services, and Sisense takes care of all security, upgrades, and maintenance. Your users can safely access Sisense and your dashboards from any location.
